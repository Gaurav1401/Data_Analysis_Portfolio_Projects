# Covid19 Data Analysis
The dataset is available at [ourworldindata]( https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)

In this project, I analysed the data using SQL queries in Microsoft SQL Server and downloaded some data in the excel sheet and later used that data to create visualizations on Tableau available [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/gaurav.kumar5784/viz/CovidDashboard_16282317449310/Dashboard1)
